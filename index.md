I'm a mathematician primarily working in algebraic geometry, currently at the University of Ferrara under Professor Alex Massarenti.
Previously I worked at the [Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati](sissa.it) under a SISSA Mathematical Fellowship,


I'm interested in birational geometry, moduli spaces, quivers, Grothendieck rings, Fano schemes, and Hodge theory.

Before arriving in Trieste, I completed a DPhil in Mathematics at the University of Oxford.

This is the Norwegian Language Council's dictionary for mathematical terms (written as a collaboration between the Norwegian Mathematics Council, the University of Oslo, the Norwegian University of Science and Technology, and the Univeristy of Agder. I contributed about 250 translations for terms relating to algebraic geometry.
