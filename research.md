### About my research:

I work in the branch of mathematics known as *algebraic geometry*.
This is a really interesting (and fun!) field, with connections to many other parts of maths and physics.

The basic object that we study in algebraic geometry is a *variety*.

A circle is a basic example of a variety -- a circle lying in the plane, say with radius 1 and centred at the origin, is the set of points where the polynomial \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\) vanishes.
An *affine* variety is the set of points in of polynomial equations in
