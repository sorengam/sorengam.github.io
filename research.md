### About my research:

I work in the branch of mathematics known as *algebraic geometry*.
This is a really interesting (and fun!) field, with connections to many other parts of maths and physics.

The basic object that we study in algebraic geometry is a *variety*.
An *affine* variety is determined by a bunch of polynomial equations
