### About my research:

I work in the branch of mathematics known as *algebraic geometry*.
This is a really interesting (and fun!) field, with connections to many other parts of maths and physics.

The basic object that we study in algebraic geometry is a *variety*.

A circle is a basic example of a variety -- a circle lying in the plane, say with radius 1 and centred at the origin, is the set of points where the polynomial \(x^2 + y^2 = 1\) vanishes.
An *affine* variety is the set of points in n--dimensional space where a bunch of polynomial equations in n variables all vanish -- and a *variety* is then a geometric object glued together from affine varieties.

For my master's thesis, I looked at cubic hypersurfaces, that is, those varieties defined by the vanishing of a single degree-3-polynomial. Especially, such varieties contain  lines, which we can parametrise with another variety, known as the *Fano scheme* associated to the cubic hypersurface.

Currently, I'm more interested in varieties that are quotients of the plane by some group of symmetries; these are sometimes called *Kleinian singularities*. If you want to parametrise tuples of points on a variety, there are different ways to do it, each slightly different. Together with A. Craw, Á. Gyenge, and B. Szendrői, we found out that these different parametrisations could all be described in a fairly simple way, essentially with just a diagram of dots, lines between them, and two numbers for each dot.

This research is most of my DPhil work.
