### Publications

I hae been a coauthor on two scientific papers.

Both were co-written with Ádám Gyenge, Alastair Craw, and Balázs Szendrői.

1. *Punctual Hilbert schemes for Kleinian singularities as quiver varieties*, in Algebraic Geometry 8 (6) (2021) 680–704. Available online [here](http://content.algebraicgeometry.nl/2021-6/2021-6-021.pdf).

2. *Quot Schemes for Kleinian Orbifolds* in SIGMA 17 (2021). Available online [here](http://sigma-journal.com/2021/099/sigma21-099.pdf).

### Preprints:

1. *Quiver Varieties and Framed Sheaves on Compactified Kleinian Singularities. Available online [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09054).
This is largely a cleaned-up version of some results from my DPhil thesis.
