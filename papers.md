### Publications

I have been a coauthor on three published scientific papers, and in addition I have three preprints available on arXiv.

1. Punctual Hilbert schemes for Kleinian singularities as quiver varieties*, in Algebraic Geometry 8 (6) (2021) 680–704. Available online [here](http://content.algebraicgeometry.nl/2021-6/2021-6-021.pdf), co-written with Ádám Gyenge, Alastair Craw, and Balázs Szendrői.

2. Quot Schemes for Kleinian Orbifolds* in SIGMA 17 (2021). Available online [here](http://sigma-journal.com/2021/099/sigma21-099.pdf), co-written with Ádám Gyenge, Alastair Craw, and Balázs Szendrői.

3. Quiver Varieties and Framed Sheaves on Compactified Kleinian Singularities. Available online [here](https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/epdf/10.1142/S0219498825503402) in Journal of Algebra and its Applications., as a preprint[here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09054). 
   This is largely a cleaned-up version of some results from my DPhil thesis, giving a set-theoretical bijection between (the closed points of) certain Nakajima quiver varieties and sets of framed sheaves on stacks compactifying Kleinian singularities.


### Preprints:


1. Moduli spaces of framed sheaves on compactified Kleinian singularities. Available online [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05960).
   This preprint constructs the spaces of framed sheaves mentioned in the previous preprint as quasiprojective schemes.
2. Noncommutative projective partial resolutions and quiver varieties. Co-authored with Ádám Gyenge. Available online [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00709).
   This preprint generalises much of the above work, constructing a class of noncommutative projective surfaces and investigating the spaces of framed sheaves on them.
3. Quiver Schemes for Nongeneric Stability and Cornering. Co-authored with Lukas Bertsch. Available online [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12156) In this preprint, we investigate the infinitesimal properties of quiver schemes in many cases, inclusing Nakajima quiver varieties.
