I was for two years the secretary of [*Taruithorn*](https://users.ox.ac.uk/~tolksoc/), the Oxford Tolkien Society.
One of my main Tolkien-related interests is Tolkienian linguistics.

## Some resources:

# Eldamo:
Probably the most up-to-date website on Tolkien's language constructions, including several (well-founded) neologisms.
[eldamo.org](eldamo.org)

# Ardalambion
A somewhat dated, but still useful website -- interesting articles on the lesser-developed languages (Valarin, Ad√ªnaic, Black Speech...)
