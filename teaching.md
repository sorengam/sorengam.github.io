## Teaching

I taught several courses as a tutor and teaching assistant, both at the University of Oslo and the Univeristy of Oxford.

#### Reading groups
In the autumn of 2020, I started to run a reading group on scheme theory for DPhil students in Oxford.
The group ran into the spring of 2021, and concluded with an introduction to Hodge theory.
I gave some of the talks, and the slides can be found here.

- Curves
- Computing cohomology
- Hodge theory 1
- Hodge theory 2
